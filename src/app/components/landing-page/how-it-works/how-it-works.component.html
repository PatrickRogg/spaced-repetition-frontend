        Spaced Repetition
      </h4>

      <p>
        As the name suggests the repetition of subjects is spaced out over a
        period of time. A topic is reviewed at particular intervals to
        forgetting it. The concept of learning something once and losing memory
        about it over time is also called the Forgetting Curve.

      <p>
        With Spaced Repetition we interrupt the Forgetting Curve by repeating of
        what we have learned. That way we encode information into our long-term
        memory.
